//The fundamental data types between Java and C++ are basically the same. 
//I'll skip some stuff. 

//1. What actually happens when you declare a variable? Demonstrate size of. 

//Why not just depend on standard sizes?

//2. What are the sizes for : int, float, double, unsigned int, char, bool
//3. Demonstrate the max size computed manually and through climits for int and uint. 

//Which is larger? Why?

//4. Try to store a number 1 greater than allowed and observe the results
//5. Try to print a number larger than the max using INT_MAX and observe the results. 
//6. Create a negative int and a negative uint. 

//What does the unsigned int do?

/**** bool weirdness ******/

//7. Create a bool and print a bool. What do you observe?
//8. Add boolalpha to the stream and try again. What happens?
//9. Set a bool value to any number greater than one. Observe the results with and without
//the boolalpha flag set. 

//10. Using cin get a bool as an input.

/**** char storage ****/

//11. Declare a char 'a'. Print it's int value. 
//12. Try some numeric operations on it. 

/**** Constants ****/

//13. Create constants in a separate h file and access them with the scope resolution
//operator.

//Whats the difference in const and constexpr?

//Skipping it for the most part but remember: 
//There's an order to things
//Pre and post increment
//typecasting
//C++'s trinary operatory
